# Neural Networks in Multiple Languages
This project demonstrates the implementation of basic neural networks in multiple programming languages. The goal is to provide simple neural network examples across different languages, illustrating how such models can be developed in each one. 

### Languages Available

- [C++](https://github.com/cneuralnetwork/Neural-Networks-in-every-Language/tree/main/C%2B%2B)
- [C](https://github.com/cneuralnetwork/Neural-Networks-in-every-Language/tree/main/C)
- [Java](https://github.com/cneuralnetwork/Neural-Networks-in-every-Language/tree/main/Java)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/cneuralnetwork/Neural-Networks-in-every-Language/tree/main/Javascript)
- [Python](https://github.com/cneuralnetwork/Neural-Networks-in-every-Language/tree/main/Python)
