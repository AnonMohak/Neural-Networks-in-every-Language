# Neural Networks in Multiple Languages
This project demonstrates the implementation of basic neural networks in multiple programming languages. The goal is to provide simple neural network examples across different languages, illustrating how such models can be developed in each one. 

### Project Overview
Neural networks are powerful models used for a variety of machine-learning tasks. This project aims to show how neural networks can be coded using different programming languages, comparing syntax, libraries, and implementation details across languages.
Each language implementation follows a similar structure, focusing on simplicity and ease of understanding for anyone wanting to learn neural networks. 

The current repository contains implementations in the following:

- C++: c++_nn.cpp
- JavaScript: javascript_nn.js
- Python: python_nn.py
